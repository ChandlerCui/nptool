This file describes the installation steps of the NPTool package


I) REQUIREMENTS
	The NPTool package depends on 4 third-party softwares:
	+ Geant4 (http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/)
	+ ROOT (http://root.cern.ch)
	+ CLHEP (http://www.cern.ch/clhep)
	+ GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

II) WORKING CONFIGURATIONS
	The NPTool package has been mainly tested (and developped) with 
	the two following configurations:
	1) Mac OS X (10.5.7) + G4 (4.9.2) + CLHEP (2.0.4.2) + ROOT (5.22/00) + GSL ()
	2) Linux Fedora (kernel ) + G4 () + CLHEP () + ROOT () + GSL ()
	Please, report any working or non-working configuration.

III) INSTALLATION
	a) The NPTool package is available via monotone (cvs-like) at 
	ipnvcs.in2p3.fr
	You can fetch the NPTool package using the following command line:
	... ...

	b) First, you need to define some environment variables. You can
	source the NPEnvironment.bash or NPEnvironment.tchrc files 
	depending on your shell.
	This step is mandatory since the Makefiles used to build the package
	depend on some of these environment variables.

	c) Then, you need to compile the NPLib.
	Go in the NPLib directory and compile doing:
		make distclean
		make
	Complementary informations can be found in the INSTALL file of the 
	NPLib directory.

	d) Then you need to compile the G4 simulation program itself.
	Go in the NPSimulation directory and compile doing:
		make clean
		make

	e) Last, you can compile the NPAnalysis part of the NPTool
	package.
	Go to the NPAnalysis directory and compile doing:
		cd Template
		make
	This step is not mandatory for the G4 simulation to work.

The NPTool package has basically three modules: the NPSimulation
module in charge of performing the G4 simulation, the NPAnalysis
module in charge of analysing the results of NPSimulation as well
as data from real experiments (e.g. MUST2 @ GANIL) and the NPLib 
module which contains a set of libraries needed both by the 
NPSimulation and NPAnalysis modules.

The detailed structure of the NPTool package is:
NPTool	/ NPLib
	/ NPSimulation
	/ NPAnalysis
	/ Inputs
	/ Outputs
	/ NPDocumentation


I) NPLib
	This directory contains a set of libraries (each one in 
	a dedicated directory) used both in the NPSimulation and
	NPAnalysis modules. 
	Complementary informations concerning each library of
	the NPLib can be found in the README file of the NPLib 
	directory.

II) NPSimulation
	This directory contains all the files needed to run the
	G4 simulation software. The structure of this directory
	is the typical structure for G4 programs with a src and
	include directory.

III) NPAnalysis
	This directory contains everything related to the analysis
	program treating the output ROOT file from NPSimulation.
	An example of such a program can be found in the subdirectory
	Template which deals with the MUST2 detector.

IV) Inputs
	This directory contains all the input files needed for 
	the G4 simulation (NPSimulation). It has the following
	structure:
	Inputs / CrossSection
	       / DetectorConstruction
	       / EventGenerator
	       / EnergyLoss

V) Outputs
	This directory contains the ROOT ouput files of the 
	G4 simulation (NPSimulation) and of the analysis
	tools (NPAnalysis). It has the following structure:
	Outputs / Analysis
		/ Simulation

VI) NPDocumentation
	You will find here in the (near?) future some detailed 
	documentation concerning NPSimulation and on how to add
	a new detector to NPSimulation.

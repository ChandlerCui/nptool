****************************************************************************
*                               GENERAL FEATURES                           *
****************************************************************************
+ NPLib
-------
  + General
    Building NPLib is now easier. 
    + The new 'scripts' directory holds bash scripts called by the main
      Makefile at the NPLib level.
    + The main Makefile calls several scripts:
      + All headers files are moved to the 'include' directory.
      + Each Makefile found in any subdirectory is called.
      + All libraries are moved to the 'library' directory.
      + Symbolic links to *.dylib files are done if on a macosx platform.
      + The 'liblist' file at NPLib level is created.

  + CalibrationManager class
     + This class handles in a nice way a collection of calibration files

  + NPReaction class
    + Now it is possible to give excitation to the light nucleus in exit channel.

  + NPOptionManager facility
    + This singleton class allows to pass arguments on the command line when
      executing NPSimulation and NPAnalysis.
    + Execute ./Simulation --help or ./Analysis --help to know the available 
      options.

  + TAsciiFile class
     + This class allows to store any regular text file in a ROOT file
     + This is used to store the event generator, detector configuration files
       in ROOT output file.

  + RootInput facility
    + Support for adding TFriend object
    + Support for using information from TAsciiFile when running NPAnalysis

  + RootOutput facility
    + Support for adding TAsciiFile object automatically

  + NPTagManager facility
    + Associate one or more string to an event in a TTree

+ NPSimulation
--------------
  + No new functionality in NPSimulation
  + Using the NPOptionManager facility, calling NPSimulation is now:
    ./Simulation -D xxx.detector -E xxx.reaction 

+ NPAnalysis
------------
  + Using the NPOptionManager facility, calling NPAnalysis is now:
       ./Analysis -D xxx.detector -E xxx.reaction -R RunToTreat.txt
  + One can also call Analysis in the following way:
       ./Analysis -R RunToTreat
    In this case the configuration files stored in TAsciiFile are used

  + A simple but functional example for MUST2 analysis can be found
    in the NPAnalysis/must2 directory.

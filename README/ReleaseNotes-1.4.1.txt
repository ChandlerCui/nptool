+ NPLib
-------
  + General
    + New Makefile.arch version

  + scripts
    + NPToolLogon.C compiles the RootInput.h header which is needed to use 
      the new RootInput makeFriendTrees() method.

  + CalibrationManager class
    + This class is now instantiated in DetectorManager (NPAnalysis).

  + NPReaction class
    + Minimum and maximum angles for the cross-section are now given in the 
      constructor. New tokens (HalfOpenAngleMin and HalfOpenAngleMax) can
      be used in EventGeneratorTransfer and EventGeneratorTransferToResonance.

  + NPOptionManager facility
    + New option --input-physical (--IP) which allows the user to consider an 
      input file containing a physic class instead of a raw data class.

  + RootInput facility
     + Add new MakeFriendTrees("RunToRead1", "RunToRead2") method which returns
       a TChain object which can be called directly in the ROOT interpreter.
       This is particularly useful when associating raw and physical data together. 

  + Add CATS directory
     + TCATSData and TCASPhysics are added. These classes are only used in NPAnalysis.


+ NPSimulation
--------------
  + Scorers: Minimum energy deposit for charged particles is now 0.1 keV
             instead of 100 keV.

+ NPAnalysis
------------
  + New layout of the analysis files in all projects
  + Makefile of each project now includes Makefile.arch from NPLib
  + Template project is now MakePhysicalTree
  + New SSSD and RRC66 analysis projects with specific analysis ROOT macros

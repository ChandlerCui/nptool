This tutorial presents how to add a new detector using the _nptool-wizard_
utility available in the nptool package. _nptool-wizard_ is a simple bash 
script that will first ask you a few information about the detector you want 
to create and the author. It will then create the needed files in the NPLib
and NPSimulation directories. These files correspond to the basic case of a
scintillator detector (rectangular or cylindrical) where energy and time
are recorded. For a more elaborated detector, it is recommended to first follow
the present tutorial and then to go to the next one. 


## Running nptool-wizard
_nptool-wizard_ is available as soon as you prepare the compilation of NPLib, 
i.e., after the _cmake ./_ command is issued. However, as a good practice, it
is recommended to compile __and__ install NPLib as a prerequisity.

Once this is done, you can call the _nptool-wizard_ utility doing:
{% highlight bash %}
$ nptool-wizard
{% endhighlight %}
The script will prompt you to give a name to your new detector (say `newdet`
as an example. Then it will ask your name and email which will be added in 
the header of each created file so that comunication between people maintaining
the package is easier. If the detector name you have chosen already exist an 
error will be issued. This behaviour can be override using the -f flag, which
will create the detector regardless to the preexisting detector files and folders.

_nptool-wizard_ will also give a list of the files created and ask whether you
want to add all these files to the Git repository. For the purpose of this 
tutorial, say _no_. If you say _yes_ a _git add_ command will be run on every 
newly created file, allowing for a fast and easy commit of your new detector. 


## Compilation of the newly created classes
In order to make your new detector fully supported and integrated in the 
_nptool_ framework you need to compile again NPLib and NPSimulation. This
can be achieved using the following list of commands:
{% highlight bash %}
$ npl
$ cmake ./
$ make -jn
$ nps
$ cmake ./
$ make -jn
{% endhighlight %}


## Running a simulation with the new detector
Performing a basic Monte Carlo simulation of the recently added detector is
as easy as running the following command line:
{% highlight bash %}
$ npsimulation -D newdet.detector -E alpha.source 
{% endhighlight %}
where newdet.detector is created by the _nptool-wizard_ utility.

The setup is made of target (blue disk) surrounded by three detectors (green),
one cylindrical and two rectangular ones. The following picture show the 
setup with 10 alpha particles shot randomly.

## How to get into the nptool collaboration

We do not enforce any strict rules on who can join and work on the code, as long as you are a nptool user and wish to contribute to the code, you are welcome!
To join simply send an email to matta@lpccaen.in2p3.fr, giving your institution, email, name, situation (PhD, Post Doc, Researcher,...), which experiments you work on and your github account name.

Once you are added to the collaboration you will need to:
  - Link your GitHub account with Travis-CI to receive notification when you break the package on one of the main branch
  - Update your GitHub email address and make sure it matches the one you are using in your git configuration

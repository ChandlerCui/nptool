Welcome to the new website for nptool. You will find here the latest news on the code devellopment, as well as a (hopefully in a near future) comprehensive manual. As of today the manual will focus mainly on installing, and running the examples, but we hope to see more about each detector. The team (P. Morfouace (MSU) and N. de Sereville (IPNO))is working hard in providing both documentation and standard examples with test data for each detector.

This new website make it easy to write documentation and integrate it into the website, and all this through github. The site use Jekyll and is host by github-pages, so it allow beautifull synthax highligthing such as:  

{% highlight cpp %}
  NPVDetector* det = new TMust2Physics();
{% endhighlight %}


Hope you enjoy navigation on this new site. If you got any queries do not hesitate to contact us.

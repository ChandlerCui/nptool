nptool is now using [Travis CI][travis] to automatically build and test each push on the NPTool.2.dev branch. The compilation is done a Ubuntu 12.04 Virtual Machine with gcc4.8. In addition we use the root-system package from Debian (Root 5.34) and a precompiled Geant4 installation (Geant4 10.1.2). A handful of test a run as well to ensure that the package is actually functionnal. More info could be found on the [Status page][status].

This file describes the installation procedure of the NPLib


In order to build all the libraries of the NPLib module, use the two 
following commands:
	
+  make distclean
	Once this is done you should check that both the include and 
	lib directories are empty. It this is not the case remove the 
	remaining files manually.

+ make
	Once this is done the headers of each subdirectory are copied to 
	the include directory and the shared libraries (*.so) associated 
	to each library are copied to the lib directory. If you are using 
	a Mac OS system a symbolic link *.dylib is done with respect to 
	each *.so library.

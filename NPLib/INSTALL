I) REQUIREMENTS
The GSL (Gnu Scientific Library) should be installed at this step as well as
a ROOT version with the MathMore module.
   + To install GSL, your distribution most likely provides a package. This is
     the case for Debian / Ubuntu / Fedora / Mac Os X for example.
   + To install ROOT's MathMore module, you have two options:
      + Install the ROOT binary which contains support for MathMore. 
      + Compile the ROOT source code with support for GSL (see this web page 
        http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/installing-root-source at the
        GSL paragraph).

The working GSL environement is needed for the NPEnergyLoss.{h,cxx} library
in the Tools directory


II) BUILDING NPLIB
In order to build all the libraries of the NPLib module, use the two 
following commands:
	
   + make distclean
	Once this is done you should check that both the include and 
	lib directories are empty. It this is not the case remove the 
	remaining files manually.

   + make
	Once this is done the headers of each subdirectory are copied to 
	the include directory and the shared libraries (*.so) associated 
	to each library are copied to the lib directory. If you are using 
	a Mac OS system a symbolic link *.dylib is done with respect to 
	each *.so library.

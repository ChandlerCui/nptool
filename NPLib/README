This directory contains a set of libraries which are used both in the 
NPSimulation and the NPAnalysis modules. The structure of this directory is:
NPLib / include
      / lib
      / scripts
      / IORoot
      / Tools + Physics
      / InitialConditions
      / InteractionCoordinates
      / CalibrationManager
      / DummyDetector
      / MUST2
      / AnnularS1
      / GASPARD
      / Paris
      / Shield
      / VDetector
      / W1
      / HYDE

A description of each directory follows.

I) include directory
	When compiling NPLib (see INSTALL file) all the headers of the libraries
	are copied to this directory

II) lib directory
	When compiling NPLib (see INSTALL file) all the shared libraries are 
	copied to this directory

III) scripts
	This directory contains several scripts used in the global Makefile and 
   for initializing ROOT.

IV) IORoot
	This directory includes one library:
		libIORoot.so
	This library contains two singleton classes (RootOutput and RootInput) used
	both in NPSimulation and NPAnalysis.
	These classes are used to deal with the input and output ROOT files and trees.

V) Tools + Physics

VI) InitialConditions
	This directory includes one library:
		libInitialConditions.so
	This library records all the information concerning the event generators, 
	e.g. vertex of interaction, angles of emitted particles...                                                 
	This class derives from TObject (ROOT) and its aim is to be stored in the 
	output TTree of the G4 simulation 

VII) InteractionCoordinates
	This directory includes one library:
		libInteractionCoordinates.so
	This library mainly records the coordinates of interaction between a particle 
	and a detector. 
	This class derives from TObject (ROOT) and its aim is to be stored in the 
	output TTree of the G4 simulation.

VIII) CalibrationManager
	This directory includes one library:
	libCalibrationManager.so
		This folder contain the the class object for managing calibration file.
	A caliration manager singleton is instantiate in NPAnalysis project.
	 
IX) DummyDetector
	This directory includes one library:
		libDUMMYDetector.so
	This library stores the results of the G4 simulation for the example detector
	DummyDetector.

X) MUST2
	This directory includes two libraries:
		libMust2Data.so
		libMust2Physics.so
	libMust2Data.so:
		This library stores the results of the G4 simulation for the Must2
		detector.
		The format mimics what was used for the GANIL experiments after conversion 
		of the raw data with GRU. Ask N. de Sereville for more informations. 
	libMust2Physics.so:
		This library deals with the treatment applied to the ROOT output file 
		obtained from NPSimulation. This library is *only* used by NPAnalysis.

XI) AnnularS1
	This directory includes one library:
		libAnnularS1Data.so
	This library stores the results of the G4 simulation for the S1 detector. 
	The format is the same as the one which is used for the GANIL experiments after 
	conversion of the raw data with GRU. Ask N. de Sereville and J. Burgunder 
	(burgunder@ganil.fr) for more informations.
	This class derives from TObject (ROOT) and its aim is to be stored in the 
	output TTree of the G4 simulation.

XII) GASPARD
	This directory includes two libraries:
		libGaspardData.so
		libGaspardPhysics.so
	libGaspardData.so:
		This library stores the results of the G4 simulation for the tracker part 
		of the Gaspard detector.
	libGaspardPhysics.so:
		This library deals with the treatment applied to the ROOT output file 
		obtained from NPSimulation. This library is *only* used by NPAnalysis.

XIII) Paris
	This directory includes tow library:
		libParisData.so
		libParisPhysics.so
	libParisData.so
		This library stores the results of the G4 simulation for the Paris detector.
	libParisPhysics.so
		This library deals with the treatment applied to the ROOT output file 
		obtained from NPSimulation. This library is *only* used by NPAnalysis.


XIV) Shield
	This directory includes two library:
		libShieldData.so
		libShieldPhysics.so
	libShieldData.so
		This library stores the results of the G4 simulation for the Shield of PARIS.
	libShieldPhysics.so
		This library deals with the treatment applied to the ROOT output file 
		obtained from NPSimulation. This library is *only* used by NPAnalysis.

XV) VDetector
	This directory includes two libraries:
		libVDetector.so
		libDetectorManager.so
	libVDetector.so:
		VDetector is a virtual class used for analysis purpose. It comes with several 
		standard methods definition called in the analysis programm automatically.
		Those method need to be implemented for each detector inheritted from the VDetector 
		class.
	libDetectorManager.so:
		DetectorManager is a class that manages a vector of VDetector and call their 
		common functions.

XVI) W1
	This directory includes two libraries:
		libW1Data.so
		libW1Physics.so
	libW1Data.so:
		This library stores the results of the G4 simulation for the W1 (Micron)
		detector.

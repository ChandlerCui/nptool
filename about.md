NPTool, which stands for Nuclear Physics Tool, is an open source and freely
distributed data analysis and Monte Carlo simulation package for low-energy
nuclear physics experiments. The NPTool package aims to offer an unified
framework for preparing and analysing complex experiments, making an efficient
use of [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/) and 
[ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) toolkits.

[//]: # (nptool is a Root and Geant4 based framework offering an easy too use, yet very rich, environment to run and developp data analysis and simulation of nuclear physics experiement.)

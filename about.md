NPTool, which stands for Nuclear Physics Tool, is an open source and freely
distributed data analysis and Monte Carlo simulation package for low-energy
nuclear physics experiments. The NPTool package aims to offer an unified
framework for preparing and analysing complex experiments, making an efficient
use of [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/) and 
[ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) toolkits.


A comprehensive overview of the package is given in the NPTool [publication][publication] in the Journal of Physics G. Please cite this article for publication of results obtained using the NPTool framework.

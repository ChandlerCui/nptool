TODO for NPTool:
----------------
   + Try to remove warnings from NPL / NPS compilation
   + Change dEdX name for EnergyLoss
   + Change map's index of scorers to deal a typical case like it is now done
     for the dE-E with 2 plastics.
   + Build a dummy detector as a simple example of how NPTool is working
   + Target work
      + Make homogeneous treatment of materials definition wrt other detectors
      + Possibility to tilt the target with a given angle and to deal with
        the emittance
      + Target object as a private member of VEventGenerator
      + Shooting in the target within a dedicated method in VEventGenerator
      + IsInsideTarget method for debugging purposes
   + Add documentation
   + Add a dedicated class to deal with materials (see example from G4 tutorial)
     (still under debate)
   + Split physic list and give the possibility to choose which package to use
   + Add support for messengers
   + Build NPTool with the Autotool/Automake

TODO for NPAnlysis:
-------------------
   + Add comment support for RunToTreat.txt
   + Add calibration manager class from Julien
   + Use only one class for the analysis per detector instead of two currently
     (ROOT feature in private member definition ( //!))
   + Check Makefiles dependency (mostly for Gaspard)

TODO for AnnularS1 detector:
----------------------------
   + Update the way the scorers are dealt to the new way (no more loop in ReadSensitive)

TODO for Gaspard:
-----------------
   + Add documentation
   + Check bug when light and heavy particles are detected in the same event
   + Improve analysis in order to deal with heterogeneous detector shapes
